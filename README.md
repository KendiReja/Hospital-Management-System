TCS HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT CASE STUDY

Just a reminder:
1. Pull the files from the development branch
2. Create a virtual environment and make sure you add the environment folder to .gitignore. 
3. Activate virtual environment
4. Install the requirements using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
5. If you are adding or installing any other flask components, do add it to the requirements.txt file.
6. Commit often using relevant messages.

Steps 2 and 3 are optional but highly recommended. 
Reason: you can just use the command "pip freeze > requirements.txt" to selectively output the required components to be installed (say, WTForms). 
Otherwise all the pip packages in your system will be added to the requirements.txt file (please don't do that).
